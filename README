Excel.wtf Linux Kernel
Excel.wtf is a gaming-optimized fork of the Linux kernel, built for low latency, high performance, and a touch of WTF flair. Itâ€™s tuned for competitive gaming, with support for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs, low-latency audio, and Steam Proton for running Windows games on Linux. Frag with style!

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first for details on the Excel.wtf fork.

To build the kernel:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fandombreh/Excel.wtf.git cd Excel.wtf
Use the gaming-optimized config: make excelwtf_defconfig
Compile the kernel: make -j$(nproc)
Install (as root): sudo make modules_install install
Update your bootloader (e.g., sudo update-grub).
In order to build the documentation, use make htmldocs or
make pdfdocs. The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
